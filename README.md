# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## This is my practice project for Tailwind CSS + React + Vite

- Video tutorial [Tailwind CSS Full Course 2023 | Build and Deploy a Nike Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS7upsfuxmo&t=2978s)
- Assets [Project assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccqjc8gJ7CLvXT_vUhVT4Gmys-Ze13FK/view)

This proved to be a strong project.
My initial expectation was that i will deal with TailwindCSS only. Soon I found out that there are lots of JS elements.

I still have to look for the right hosting services. Code will remain on GitHub but a working interface needs to be showcased one reliant web hosting server.
